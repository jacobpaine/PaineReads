#PaineReads
PaineReads is a front-end and back-end library app intended to be used with a local PostgreSQL database and the PaineScans app. PaineReads includes a dynamic server input box. This box is, in general, a convenience for development. When using this app, the address will have to be changed to a different local or Heroku address depending on the user's setup with PostgreSQL. 

An example is available [here](https://obscure-waters-34258.herokuapp.com).
